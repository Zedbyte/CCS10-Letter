                    Dear Self,
                    How are you doing today?  Kamusta na?
                    I hope you are doing fine while reading this letter of us.
                    During the Midterm Period in CCS10 – Introduction to Computing (Laboratory Part), 
                    I   learned the Basic of HTML; how to create the basic html structures, html tags, 
                    headings, different paragraph alignments, formatting text commonly being used in 
                    Mathematical  Notations,  Physics,  and  Chemistry,  also,  in  terms  of  its  color,  size, 
                    and font type/face, and creating Lists of Different Types.  We were taught of using 
                    combination  of  colors  in  text  and  sizes.    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <div class = "section">

                        <ul class = "gratitude">
                            <li>
                                <a> 
                                    I  am  thinking  what  if  I  create  a  “Two 
                                    Sentence’s Letter of Appreciation” addressed to our parents for always being there 
                                    by  our  side  in  this  time  of  pandemic,  in  HTML  using  the  colors  of  rainbow  with 
                                    different  text  sizes  using  the  absolute  and  relative  scale,  and  small  and  big  tags.  
                                </a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </div>
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With  these  things  in  mind,  I  guess  we  will  be  jumping  up  and  down  with  joy  and 
                    laughter, making the HTML world getting clearer and better to enjoy with. 
                    Additionally, I believed it will also enable smaller minds to grow bigger and larger 
                    until  it  reaches  its  maximum  potential.    Looking  forward  to  the  next  HTML  topic 
                    waiting  ahead  of  us,  will  surely  double  if  not  triple  the  current  knowledge  and 
                    learning that we are having in this particular area of study. “Doing all of these things 
                    in mind with ABSOLUTE HONESTY will truly make ourselves proud and our parents 
                    even prouder”.  Good Luck and Happy Learning to Us All!!!
