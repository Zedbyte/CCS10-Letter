                        I hope this letter finds you <strong>well.</strong> You've survived a lot of <ins>hurdles.</ins> <strong>Alone.</strong> You taught yourself how to be <strong>strong</strong> at all times. 
                        I can say that ever since you were a <small>child</small>, you were <ins>independent</ins>. Stop <sub>underestimating</sub> yourself. You were always <span style="color:red;">fa</span><span style="color:orange">sc</span><span style="color: yellow;">in</span><span style="color:lime;">at</span><span style="color: cyan;">ed</span> with 
                        <span class = parent-box><span class = "box"><strong>technology</strong> and <strong>computers</strong></span></span>
                        from day <ins>1</ins> until <strong>today</strong>. <mark>I still remember the days that you were dreaming of having your personal computer.</mark>
                        In the past, you were always trying to borrow computers and gadgets from your relatives, just to play with them 
                        because you <del>don't have one.</del> You were deprived of things that <small>kids</small> had but you're okay with it. You were okay to <em>adjust and to adapt.</em> 
                        You tried making your <sup>imaginary</sup> <ins>console, phone, or even a laptop</ins> using <span style="background-color: burlywood;">cardboards.</span> You are the type of person that likes to ask the <b>how and why</b> behind everything, 
                        then you often ends up <b>stressing</b> <sup>over</sup> it. You are <span style="font-size: 35px;">overthinking</span> things that shouldn't be and I think that's the price of <ins>knowledge</ins>. 
                        Your <strong>hardwork</strong> gave you knowledge on things. I realized that being too smart can be hard,   sometimes being <del>oblivious</del> is a <span style="background-color: green;">good</span> thing. 
                        Time passed, at the middle of <ins>5th grade</ins>, <mark><strong>you were given your own computer.</strong></mark> I can still remember the <span style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right,yellow, cyan, orange);">excitement, the joy, and the happy feeling</span> that you can't 
                        explain and <b>nothing</b> can replace. <i>Do you still remember the first thing that you did with it?</i> <ins>You tried on playing a song from Youtube but it didn't play.</ins>
                        <i>Why?</i> There was no internet connection at that time. You were wondering why and by the time that you realized, <em>you thought that you know nothing of technology.</em>
                        So you <strong>studied hard</strong> about it, just to play those games that you dreamt of. From <em>simple troubleshooting, tinkering, and re-connecting of cables.</em> At that time, 
                        <b>Information Technology</b> was still <span style="font-size: 30px;">growing.</span> But still, you decided that you are going to take <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology">BSIT</abbr> in college. Now you have it. Your dream is here, your first step is 
                        happening. I can still remember the time of pandemic, It was a <strong>life changer</strong> for aspiring developers. You had so much time so you chose to study the fundamentals of 
                        programming. You were so clueless about it, but you worked hard. Even if the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">impostor syndrome</a></span></strong> hits you hard, <strong>you didn't give up</strong> and I thank you for that. 
                        You tried on making simple programs until you learned even the <small>basics.</small> <strong>Your self-study is worth it.</strong>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "second-part">
                        During your <ins>Senior High School Life</ins>, you were excited on taking the <abbr title="Information, Communication, and Technology">ICT</abbr> strand. However, you were not taught of anything <sup>important</sup> about <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>. 
                        You were <sub>dissapointed</sub> but still graduated, though you didn't learn the things that you expected to learn. <abbr title="Senior High School">SHS</abbr> stopped you from <em>self-studying</em> as you don't 
                        have any more time to do it because of the <span style="font-size: 25px;">amount</span> of <b>activities and performance tasks</b> that you have to do especially that you were still adjusting 
                        with <ins>online classes.</ins> The <strong>burnout hit you hard</strong>, you were having a <b>hard time</b> for <ins>2</ins> years. <em>But you still did it, dude. </em>
                        During the vacation before college, you continued your self-study. You <storng>studied hard</storng> to the point that you were having <strong>headaches</strong> almost <ins>every day</ins>. 
                        You stopped <del>playing games</del>, and focused on studying <span class = "parent-box"><span class = "box">programming and technology.</span></span> It was so <strong>worth</strong> it.  You learned <span style="font-size: 25px;">A LOT</span> and when I say <span style="font-size: 25px;">LOT I MEAN A LOT</span>. 
                        You learned what's behind technology, from the <em><strong>transistors, binary, and etc.</strong></em> You learned programming languages like <mark><b>Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, and C.</b></mark>
                        You even enrolled in <span class = "emphasis">CS50x of Harvard</span> but at the moment it's giving you a hard time so you put it on hold as you can't do the <em>CS50x</em> course and your <em>studies</em> simultaneously 
                        so it will have to wait. You also learned Web Development, from the structure of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to the depths of HTML DOM.
                        You learned technical terms in technology like <i>APIs, Version Control, and so much more</i> that if I listed them here It will make this letter so <span style="font-size: 25px;">looong.</span>

                    <div class = "third-part">
                        Now in College, the first thing that you did is you created a <b>Discord Bot</b> for your section using the <i>discord api</i>. 
                        Now, you are being taught of Programming for <span style="font-size: 25px;text-decoration: underline;">REAL</span>. During the <ins>Midterm Period in CCS10 - Introduction to Computing</ins>, 
                        you were taught of  <span style="color:red;">di</span><span style="color:orange">fe</span><span style="color: yellow;">re</span><span style="color:lime;">nt</span> jobs that you can apply to in the <strong>future</strong>. In the Lab Part, the first thing that you did is you were asked to <span style="display:flex;justify-content: center;">center</span> a text, 
                        and you <em>successfully did it!</em> The self-study is now being practiced. You are being taught of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> more in <sub>depth</sub>. <b>Sir Ray Nicolas</b> is teaching you things that you 
                        didn't even know in the past. We didn't know that HTML has so much things in its pockets, and we thought that it only relies on CSS. I'm enjoying the class because 
                        a professional is now teaching me and I don't have to rely so much on self-studying similar to the <del>past</del> anymore. Sir Ray taught you the fundamentals of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, 
                        from the basics like;

                                    This part of the letter is for our parents. They helped us so much in achieving our goals. Without them, maybe it will be hard to live. 
                                    Pursuing BSIT without them to guide us would be the hardest part of our life. So with this, I would like to thank our parents for sticking beside us 
                                    so you have to study hard and graduate to achieve your promise in ourselves that you will give them everything that they didn't have during their days.
